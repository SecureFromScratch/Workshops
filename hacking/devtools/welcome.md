# Welcome

This lab is designed for **hands-on exploration of OWASP Juice Shop using only the browser’s Developer Tools** — no scanners, scripts, or external tools.  
Students will learn how attackers uncover client-side weaknesses through **source inspection, network tracing, storage analysis, and live code manipulation** directly within DevTools.

# The challanges
- Find the scoreboard
- Try to change others' orders
- Bypass the authentication by modifying in-memory state or calling exposed functions
- Manipulate authentication tokens stored on the client to change privileges or view protected content.
- XSS - Find a place where user input is reflected into the DOM without sanitization and achieve JS execution in the page context.

# Solutions 
In the next pages will show the solution one after anohter
