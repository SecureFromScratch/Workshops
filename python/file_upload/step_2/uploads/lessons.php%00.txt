File Upload - prevent: verify, trust boundaries
When a user upload a file we have to make sure the file doesn't damage the application.


plot:
A content management system for recipes

* complete the api post method for uploading a recipe and save it on the disk (step 1)
* a benign user will put the file we expected but a malicious user might put other files
  for example, an aspx or php web page with functionality of her choice.
  she might guess where the upload folder is, and use the web page for malicious activity
  to protect the application and the server we have to make sure that the users will upload only files types that we allow
  make sure you check the extension carefully.
  For example, if we check in our code that the file name contains ".txt",
  an attacker might attempt to upload a file named as "webshell.txt.php" (step  2)
* make sure you check not only the file extension but also the mime type.
  it might take more trouble for the attacker to make it work without the proper extension, but
  we can never know what other vulnerabilities might help her to change the file extension after the upload (step 3 )
* Now, please develop a form that gets the image as well as some details about the user.
  make sure you repeat the same validations.
  also, a naughty user might attempt to put the recipe on a folder you didn't expect.
  how could you avoid this situation? (step 4)
