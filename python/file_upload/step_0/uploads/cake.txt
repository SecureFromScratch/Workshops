### Quick Sponge Cake Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup sugar
- 4 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder (optional for a little extra lift)

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9-inch cake pan or line it with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. If you're using vanilla extract, add it in during this step.
3. Sift the flour (and baking powder, if using) into the egg mixture. Gently fold it in until just combined. Avoid overmixing to keep the cake light and airy.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top.
5. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
6. Let the cake cool in the pan for a few minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
