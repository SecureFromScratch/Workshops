.NET
* Server won't load due to network binding problem
  - You need to put your local IP (v4) in appsettings.json (in the MyDeviceIp field).
    You can use ipconfig to find out your ip.v4.
* localdb attachment does not work
  - try installing sqlexpress 2019 (IMPORTANT: Visual Studio 2022 *requires* sqlexpress *2019*)
  - localdb doesn't like relative paths. 
    In "appsettings.json", try using an absolute path to recipes-api\\data\\recipes.mdf
    i.e. C:\\Users\\yariv\\source\\repos\\Workshops\\csharp\\recipes_dotnet8_angular17\\recipes-api\\data\\recipes.mdf
  - If you have Windows11, it might be due to this problem:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/database-file-operations/troubleshoot-os-4kb-disk-sector-size
    Only fix that worked for me was setting the regedit attribute that's in the article (CAREFUL!)
    to revert sector size behavior back to windows10 and setting the database connection string to
    work with sqlexpress instead of localdb:
    ----------------------------------
    "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=localhost\\sqlexpress;Initial Catalog=Recipes;Integrated Security=True;Trust Server Certificate=True"
    },
    ----------------------------------
    NOTE: You will need to attach the database at recipes-api/data/recipes_2.mdf to sql server
    Do not attach recipes-api/data/recipes.mdf - it will probably not work.

Angular
* tinymce doesn't work
  - tinemce requires a license. look for apikey in the html files. You will see an apikey.
    Register with tinymce cloud for an apikey and update it.
